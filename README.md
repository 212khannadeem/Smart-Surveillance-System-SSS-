Smart Surveillance System
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Smart Surveillance System project, which was developed as part of the MCA (Master of Computer Applications) program at Aligarh Muslim University under the supervision of Prof. Aasim Zafar.

Project Description
Surveillance systems play a crucial role in ensuring safety and security in various
environments. However, existing systems face limitations in real-time monitoring, accurate
threat detection, processing large-scale visual data, and addressing privacy concerns. To
overcome these challenges, the development of smart surveillance systems incorporating
artificial intelligence and advanced analytics is essential. These systems aim to automate
monitoring processes, improve threat detection accuracy, and provide proactive and
intelligent monitoring capabilities. By leveraging advanced technologies, smart
surveillance systems have the potential to revolutionize security operations and enhance
safety in diverse domains.
